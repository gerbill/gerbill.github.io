# RUST SERVER CHEATSHEET

## Installation

These Rust Linux Server installation instructions are for Ubuntu 16.04 server (should probably work for Ubuntu version 12.04 or greater)

###System requirements

* RAM: 6 - 12GB
* CPU: Choose CPU with most performace per each core. No point in many cores. A CPU with 4 powerful cores (3.5 - 4.5 Ghz) would work the best.
* Bandwidth: 100 Mb/s should work fine. Ping should be minimal tho.
* Hard drives: SSD is the only option for best performance.
