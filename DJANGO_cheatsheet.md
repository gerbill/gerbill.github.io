# Django Cheat Sheet

## Setting up Django locally (Mac)

#### Create a project directory and cd to it
```bash
mkdir projectname
```
```bash
cd projectname
```

#### Create a virtual environment named "myvenv" for your django project
```bash
python3 -m venv myvenv
```

#### Start virtual environment by running
```bash
source myvenv/bin/activate
```
If you are using PyCharm you will also need to set up myvenv there. Simply go to Preferences > Project > Project Interpreter and in the gear menu choose "Add local"
